# RNotebook

This was one of my research projects form 2014, similar to Jupyter notebook (back then known as IPython),
implemented as a Java Swing application.  The notebook used Mozilla Rhino Javascript engine which allowed
for intermixing javascript code and java objects.

## Build

Run `ant` command in the project root directory.
